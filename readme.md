# Fashion Different

## Why?
This site was created together with Jaap Klerx. We created it as a part of a school project.

## Current status
Most of the core features have been implemented. We still need to update a lot of the documentation. The front-end is a mess, so that will need to be taken care of as well.

## In need of a developer
We are in need of a front-end developer who can swap out the Bootstrap that we've used for testing purposes, for our custom design.
