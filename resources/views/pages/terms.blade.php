	<h2>Terms of service</h2>
	<p>This site is meant to be a nice place for everybody. To keep it like that, we have set up some rules. We will explain them here.</p>

	<a id="be-nice"></a>
	<h3>Be nice</h3>
	<p>Don't post offensive comments on somebody else's fashion elements. You may not agree with someone's taste in fashion, but don't let them know that the hard way. We maintain the rule that if we have to remove a comment of you twice, your right to post comments will be revoked, irreversibly.</p>

	<a id="photos"></a>
	<h3>Photos</h3>
	<p>Please don't upload any irrelevant photos to this site. We are fashion-oriented, so don't upload photos of a football match. (We do love to see your football shoes though.) Also, don't upload photos that aren't suitable for all audiences, so no graphic images or nudity. Photos of swimwear are allowed.</p>
	<p>Photos that you've uploaded will stay on this site eternally (well, that is as long as this site will exist). You keep all the rights of the image, but you give us permission to use it forever. That also means that in the occasion that you want to delete your account, the photo will stay on the site.</p>
